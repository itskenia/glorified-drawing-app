# glorified-drawing-app
made by adya, kenia, and shragvi

you can draw, undo, clear, change colors, and get your artwork "judged" by famous celebrities :DDD

made for midnight hacks hackathon 

originally was going to be a game like skribbl and gartic phone, 
but ended up having issues with outdated sources of socket.io 
so we made it into a fun drawing game where kim k, pitbull, and the rock judge your work
